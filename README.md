# Aviation Industry risk assesment
This project aims at assessing  civil aviation accidents and  incidences risks  to  inform decision on entry.
## Overview
This project aims at assessing  civil aviation accidents and  incidences risks  to  inform decision on entry.
## The Project.
The project uses data on civil aviation accidents and selected incidences from 1962 -2023 from the USA National Transportation Safety Board mined from Kaggle.com based on the Cross Industry Standard Data mining Methodology.The data is analysed and used to map out potential risks factors associated with aviation industry, the finding will assist to advice and inform decision on entry to the Aviation Idustry business.
The project results may be used in the aviation industry to implementing and maintaining effective risks adaptation and mitigation measures.
## Data analytics.
This data has statistics on Events date, Location, Aircraft Make and Model,Aircraft Category,Flight purpose among many other statistics that are important in providing information on the appropriate aircrafts to purchase for different purposes.The aviation accidents Data has 88889 rows and 31 columns,the columns provide indicative information on different parameters associated with accidents and incidences investigated between 1962-2023.
## Data analysis
The data is analysed using python programming language,from the data, Anchorage a location in Alaska State had 434 aviation accidents investigated, the top ten locations contributed to 1918 locations of aviation accidents during the period.Miami in Florida recorded 200 investigationsAlbuqerque in New Mexico had 196 investigations.77,303 accidents and incidences occoured under conditions in which pilots had sufficient visibility to fly aircraft relying on visual references(VMC).cesina model 152 had the highest accident incidents investigated. 82,697 flight uses were investigated, 49,448 involved flights on personal purpose use, 10,601 on instructuonal use,Aerial application and for Busines uses had 4,712 and 4,018 incidences respectively.Cecena Model had the most fatalities at 16,926 followed by piper model with 8,976, CESSNA and Beech had 4,060 and 3039 fatalities respectively, while GRUMMAN, BoeIng and BOEING had the least number of fatalities in that order. is the most prefered Model for Personal use.
## Conlusion.
1.  Personal use of Aircraft is the most preffered use, folowed by Instructional then Aerial application and as such the company should engange in hiring aircafts for personal use or for Instructional business.
2.  Grumman and Boeing are the least risky Aircrafts to purchase for business and pesonal use.
3.   Reciprocating engine type is the most preffered engine type.
